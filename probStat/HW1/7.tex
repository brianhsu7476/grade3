The probability that Dr. Jones purchased a new umbrella on a day is the chance of raining and Dr. Jones visiting the library and the umbrella being stolen, which is $0.5\times0.8\times0.25=0.1$.\\
The probability that the $10$-th time getting stolen happens right on the $20$-th day is the probability that Dr. Jones got stolen for exactly $9$ times in the $1$-st to $19$-th day, and got stolen in the $20$-th day, which is $\binom{19}90.9^{10}0.1^9\times0.1=\binom{19}90.09^{10}$.
