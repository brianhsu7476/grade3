\begin{pr}[2.12.26]$ $
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Everybody just votes according to their rankings:\\
In the first vote (Alice or Bob), Boris and Horace will choose Alice, while Maurice will choose Bob, so Alice wins.\\
In the second vote (Alice or nobody), Boris and Maurice will choose Alice, while Horace will choose nobody, so Alice wins.
\item The reason why Horace should switch to voting for the candidate he likes least at the first vote:\\
If in the first vote, Bob wins instead of Alice, then in the second vote (Bob or nobody), Boris, Horace will choose nobody, while Maurice will choose Bob, so nobody wins instead of Alice, which is a best result for Horace.
\item Everybody votes strategically:\\
In the second vote, all of them will vote according to their rankings since the second vote will determine the result.\\
$\so$ the strategy to the second vote is same as the above.\\
That is, if Alice wins in the first vote, then Alice will win in the second vote; if Bob wins in the first vote, then nobody will win in the second vote.\\
Therefore in the first vote, it is equivalent to voting for Alice or nobody to win.\\
Boris and Maurice will choose Alice, while Horace will choose nobody, so Alice wins in the end.
