Let the graph decribed in the problem be $G$.\\
Consider $H:=G\setminus C_m$. That is, $H$ is the single path from $u$ to $v$ with $n$ edges.\\
Let $h'_{uv}$ be the hitting time on graph $H$.\\
Let $R'_{eff}(u, v)$ be the equivalent resistance of $u, v$ on $H$.\\
In class, we know that $h'_{uv}+h'_{vu}=2n\times R'_{eff}(u, v)=2n\times n$.\\
Since $u, v$ are symmetric in $H$.\\
$\so h'_{uv}=h'_{vu}$.\\
$\so h'_{vu}=\frac12\times2n^2=n^2$.\\
Since when starting from $v$, one will not walk through any edge of $C_m$ before arriving $u$.\\
$\so h_{vu}=h'_{vu}=n^2$.\\
Let $R_{eff}(u, v)$ be the equivalent resistance of $u, v$ on $G$.\\
Again, in class, we know that $h_{uv}+h_{vu}=2(m+n)\times R_{eff}(u, v)=2(m+n)n$.\\
$\so h_{uv}=2(m+n)n-h_{vu}=2(m+n)n-n^2=2mn+n^2$.
