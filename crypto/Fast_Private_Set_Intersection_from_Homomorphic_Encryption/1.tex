\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Private Set Intersection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Public: $N_X, N_Y, \sigma$
\item Sender: $X\subseteq\{0, 1\}^\sigma$ with size $N_X$
\item Receiver: $Y\subseteq\{0, 1\}^\sigma$ with size $N_Y$
\item Goal:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sender should not know anything about $Y$.
\item Receiver should know $X\cap Y$.
\item Receiver should not know anything about $X\setminus Y$.
\end{itemize}
\item Threat model: semi-honest security model (both parties correctly follow the protocol, but may try to learn as much as possible from their view of the protocol execution)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fast Private Set Intersection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Original communication complexity: $O(N_XN_Y)$
\item Goal communication complexity: $O(N_Y\log N_X)$
\item The protocol works for all $N_X, N_Y$, but since it's powerful when $N_X\gg N_Y$, assume that $N_X\gg N_Y$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Homomorphism: $\varphi: A\to B$ with $\varphi(x\circ_Ay)=\varphi(x)\circ_B\varphi(y)$.
\item Homomorphic Encryption: $\enc, \dec$ are homomorphisms.
\item Types of homomorphic encryption: (distinguish by the arithmetic circuits they support)
\begin{itemize}
\item PHE (partially homomorphic encryption): one type of gates with unlimited depth
\item SHE (somewhat homomorphic encryption): two types of gates with limited depth
\item Leveled fully homomorphic encryption: multiple types of gates with limited depth
\item FHE (fully homomorphic encryption): multiple types of gates with unlimited depth
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{IND-CPA Secure}
\begin{itemize}
\item IND-CPA: indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack
\item Steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Challenger: Generate $(pk, sk)$.
\item Adversary: Choose and send $m_0, m_1$ to the challenger.
\item Challenger: Uniformly randomly choose $b\in\{0, 1\}$, and send $\enc(m_b, pk)$ back to the adversary.
\item Adversary: Submit a guess for $b$.
\end{itemize}
\item Restriction: The adversary can only perform polynomially bounded number of operations.
\item Goal: The adversary's guess is correct with probability $\frac12+\negl(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumption}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\fenc, \fdec$: Encryption and decryption of a IND-CPA secure FHE scheme
\item Threat model: semi-honest security model
\item $N_X\gg N_Y$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
