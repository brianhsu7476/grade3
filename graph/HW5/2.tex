By section 6.2, the vertices and the edges on the football form a planar graph.\\
Suppose that it contains $a$ pentagons, $b$ hexagons, $v$ vertices, $e$ edges.\\
By proposition 6.10, $2e=5a+6b$.\\
By Euler's formula, $v-e+a+b=2\then 6v-6e+6a+6b=12$.\\
By handshake lemma, $3v=2e$ since it's a $3$-regular graph.\\
$6a+6b-2e=4e-6e+6a+6b=6v-6e+6a+6b=12$.\\
$\then 6a+6b-(5a+6b)=12$.\\
$\then a=12$.\\
$\so$ there are $12$ pentagons.
