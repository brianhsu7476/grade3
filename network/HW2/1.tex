\begin{itemize}
\item A circuit-switched network is more appropriate for this application.\\
Reason:
\begin{itemize}
\item A circuit-switched network provides a dedicated path for the transmission, which gaurantees the steady bandwidth.
\item The bandwidth usage is not inefficient since the application will continue running for a relatively long period of time when it starts.
\item A circuit-switched network provides low latency since the path is predetermined.
\item A packet-switched network may have packet-overflow problem.
\end{itemize}
\item No congestion control is needed.\\
Reason: Even if all of the applications transmit at the same time, since the bandwidth of each link is greater than the sum of all of the applications' data rate, no congestion will happens. Therefore, no congestion control is needed.
\end{itemize}
