\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item False, since a request message will be sent for each object, four request messages will be sent instead of one.
\item True, since these two Web pages are under the same server \texttt{www.mit.edu}.
\item False, since the connection closes in a nonpersitent connection after each connection, the TCP will close after dealing with the first request, and therefore the two requests won't share the same TCP segment.
\item False, Date is the time the request was created but not that of the object last modified.
\item False, HTTP status 304 has an empty message body.
