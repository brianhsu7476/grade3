\begin{pr}
\texttt{ADD successor to closed} should not be at the first time \texttt{successor} is inserted to fringe. Instead, it should be at the first time \texttt{successor} is removed from fringe. Reason: The first time that \texttt{successor} is inserted may not have the highest priority. If \texttt{ADD successor to closed} is added at the first time \texttt{successor} is inserted to fringe, then the solution it finds may not be the optimal one.
