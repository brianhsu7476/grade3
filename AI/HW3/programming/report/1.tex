One can see that the performance of using random forest is the best in both classification and regression tasks. The reason is that comparing to the other $2$ methods, random forest can deal with outliers better. Outliers don't affect that much to the result of running random forest. The reason that decision tree performs better than the linear model may be that the data is not linearly separable.
